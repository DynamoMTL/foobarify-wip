# Pipelify - A modern pipeline for Shopify website development

(CI badges ?)

Pipelify aims at giving you access to a better, smoother and more modern workflow for building, testing and deploying Shopify themes and websites.

It is built on top of Webpack 2 and allows to use tools such as ESlint, Babel, Sass, SVGO, Themekit, Stylelint and Jest to help you count on features like ES6+ support, module bundling, hot module reloading, automatic watch-and-deploy, JS unit testing, asset fingerprinting, and much more!

Excited? Let's get started!
